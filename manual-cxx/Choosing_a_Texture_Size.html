</p><p>Most graphics hardware requires that your texture images always
be a size that is a power of two in each dimension.  That means you
can use any of the following choices for a texture size: 1, 2, 4, 8,
16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or so on (but unless you have a
<i>really</i> high-end card, you'll probably need to stop there).
</p><p>The textures don't usually have to be <i>square:</i> they don't have
to have the same size in both dimensions.  But each dimension does
usually have to be a power of two.  So 64 &#215; 128 is all
right, for instance, or 512 &#215; 32, or
256 &#215; 256.  But you can't make a texture image that is
200 &#215; 200 pixels, since 200 isn't a power of two.
</p><p>By default, Panda3D will automatically rescale any texture image
down to the nearest smaller power of two when you read it from disk,
so you usually don't have to think about this--but your application
will load faster if you scale your textures properly in the first
place.
</p><p>If you would like Panda3D to rescale your images up to the next larger power of two instead of down to the next smaller power of two, use:
</p>
<pre class="text">textures-power-2 up</pre>
<p>In your config file.  The default is:
</p>
<pre class="text">textures-power-2 down</pre>
<p>As of version 1.8.0, another mode was added which adds black borders as needed to frame the texture within a larger power-two texture. To enable this mode instead, use:
</p>
<pre class="text">textures-power-2 pad</pre>
<p>In your config file.
</p><p>It will then be up to your code to apply <code>texture.getTexScale()</code> where needed. This mode does, of course, prevent using repeated textures.
</p><p>Although you usually shouldn't use non power-of-two textures, for some things like GUI graphics it is not very uncommon to have them like that and let the game engine scale or pad them automatically.
</p><p>Note that the size you choose for the texture image has
nothing to do with the size or shape of the texture image
onscreen--that's controlled by the size and shape of the polygon you
apply it to.  Making a texture image larger won't make it make it
appear larger onscreen, but it will tend to make it crisper and more
detailed.  Similarly, making a texture smaller will tend to make it
fuzzier.
</p><p><b>Padded Textures</b>
</p><p>Sometimes, you need to load data into a texture every frame.
The most common example is when you're playing a movie.  Let's say,
for example, that the movie is encoded at 640x480 at 30fps.  Neither
of those dimensions is a power-of-two. It would theoretically be
possible for Panda3D to rescale the image to 512x512, but it would
have to do it 30 times per second, which is too expensive to be
practical.
</p><p>Instead, panda <i>pads</i> the data.  Panda creates a 1024x512
texture, which is the smallest power-of-two size that can
hold a 640x480 movie.  It sticks the 640x480 movie
into the lower-left corner of the texture.  Then, it adds a black
border to the right edge and top edge of the movie, padding it
out to 1024x512.
</p><p>From that point forward, it's just a texture with a movie in the
lower-left corner, and black bars on the upper and right sides.
However, if you use UV coordinates carefully, you can cause just
the movie to be displayed.  To do this, you need to know how big those
black bars are:
</p>
<pre class="python">padx = texture.<span style="color: black;">getPadXSize</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><br />pady = texture.<span style="color: black;">getPadYSize</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
<p>Panda3D only uses padded textures in a few very special cases:
1. When playing a non-power-of-two movie.
2. When using render-to-texture, and a non-power-of-two buffer.
</p><p><b>Nonstandard Texture Sizes</b>
</p><p>Some newer graphics cards can render textures that are not a power of
two.  This is generally not very useful for loading art from disk: after
all, game art is usually created in power-of-two sizes no matter what.
However, it is useful to avoid wasteful movie padding of the kind described
above.  If you have one of these cards and you want to enable the use
of non-power-of-two textures, you can put the following line in
your Config.prc:
</p>
<pre class="text">textures-power-2 none</pre>
<p>You can also attempt to have panda detect your video card's capabilities automatically, using this command:
</p>
<pre class="text">textures-auto-power-2 #t</pre>
<p>If this variable is true, then panda will wait until you open a window, and
then ask the window's driver if the driver supports non-power-of-two
textures.  If so, then the config variable <code>textures_power_2</code> will automatically be adjusted.  In this way, you can configure Panda3D to use non-power-of-two textures if they are available.
</p><p>Caution: there is a potential pitfall when using <code>textures-auto-power-2</code>.  If you open a window that supports non-power-of-two textures, panda will switch into <code>textures-power-2 none</code> mode.  If you then open a <i>second</i> window using a different video card which doesn't support non-power-of-two textures, then panda will have no choice but to print an error message.
</p><p>Note that some cards <i>appear</i> to be able to render
non-power-of-two textures, but the driver is really just scaling the
textures at load time.  With cards like these, you're better off
letting Panda do the scaling, or dynamic textures may render
<i>very</i> slowly.
